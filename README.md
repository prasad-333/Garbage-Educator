# Garbage Educator

Garbage Educator helps you to learn waste segregation.
1. You launch the app & select the desired location of the world.
2. App will show different places in that location(consider them as different game levels) to play the game.
3. Once selected a particular place, it will show dustbins as per waste separation on the screen. So background(actual location) will keep changing at each level as you advance to next level.
4. On play button click, you will see objects on the screen, you have to select the correct dustbin to dispose those objects(garbage).
5. If the correct dustbin is selected, you get points on points table.
6. If an incorrect dustbin is selected, you get information about waste  (& may be HINT button to know which is the correct dustbin for disposable. )
7. As you advance the level, time limit to select dustbin will reduce to make it more interesting to play like a game.
